flow-to-room
============

Chrome extension that replaces occurrences of 'flow' and 'flows' with 'room' and 'rooms', respectively.

Does not match inside strings so even references to things like workflows, or even Flowdock itself will remain intact.

Shamelessly (and gratefully) forked from @panicsteve's [Cloud-to-Butt Chrome plugin](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt). Created in response to Flowdock users that don't want to refer to rooms as "flows".

This is a quick and dirty spike; there is ample opportunity to improve its performance. For the time being, its functional, but not fast enough to consider "v1.0"

Installation
------------

In Chrome, choose Window > Extensions.  Drag FlowToRoom.crx into the page that appears.
